        "description": "Used after April 28, 2020. Nine-point aggregation of the eight containment and closure indicators as well as H1 (public information campaigns). It reports a number between 0 to 100 that reflects the overall stringency of the governments response. This is a measure of how many of these nine indicators (mostly around social isolation) a government has acted upon, and to what degree.",
